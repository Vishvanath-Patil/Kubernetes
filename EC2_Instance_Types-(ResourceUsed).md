# EC2-Instances-Types ( Resource Use cases )

Amazon EC2 Provides us with a wide selection of instance types that are optimized for different use cases.

Instance types comprises of varying combination of CPU, Memory, Storage and networking Capacity 
and this gives us the flexibility to choose the most appropriate mix of resources fot the application.

Each instance type includes one or more instance sizes, that allows us to scale the resources to the requirements of the target workloads

The instance types can be devided into following :
1. General purpose
2. Compute Optimized
3. Memory Optimized
4. Storage Optimized
5. Accelerated computing
6. HPC Optimized

## 1. General Purpose Instances ( Balance of Compute(CPU), Memory and Network ) Basically m family
General purpose instances provides a balance of **compute**, **memory** and **networking** resources and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.

• These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as **web-servers** and **code repositories**.

## 2. Compute Optimaized ( High Processors ) c family
Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors.

• Instances belonging to this category are well suited for batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web server,
high performance computing, scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference and other compute intensive applications

## 3. Memory Optimaized ( Large Data Sets in Memory ) r family
• Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

• Memory optimized instances are ideal for memory intensive workloads such as open-source databases, in-memory caches and real-time big data analytics.

## 4. Storage optimized instances: d family
• Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.

• They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.

• These are ideal for I/O intensive applications and are targeted to customers using transactional databases, Amazon OpenSearch service and real-time analytics such as Apache Spark.

## 5. Accelerated Computing 
• Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations,
graphics processing or data pattern matching, more efficiency than is possible in software running on CPUs.

• These are ideal for machine learning, high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, 
speech recognition, autonomous vehicles and drug discovery.

## 6. HPC ( High Performance Work-loads ) hpc family
• High Performance Computing (HPC) instances are purpose built to offer the best price performance for running HPC workloads at scale on AWS.

• HPC instances are ideal for applications that benefit from high-performance such as large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads.
